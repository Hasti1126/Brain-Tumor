# Project Title

Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for the detection of brain tumors. The model utilizes advanced techniques in deep learning to analyze medical images, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and classify them into tumor or non-tumor categories.

## Installation

- Clone the repository using `git clone <repository_url>`
- Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

- Run the `app.py` script to start the brain tumor detection application.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to input the MRI image file for analysis.
- View the results of the tumor detection on the console or in a generated report.

## Dataset

- The dataset consists of MRI images obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection.
- Images are in the DICOM format and have been preprocessed to ensure consistency.
- The dataset includes labeled images of both tumor and non-tumor cases.

## Model Architecture

- The deep learning model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.
- It consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- ReLU activation functions are used for intermediate layers, and a softmax activation function is applied to the final output layer.

## Training

- The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001.
- The training data was split into training and validation sets with an 80:20 ratio.
- Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation and flipping, were applied to increase the diversity of the training samples.

## Evaluation

- The model's performance was evaluated on a separate test set of labeled MRI images.
- Evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- The trained model achieved an accuracy of 90% on the test set.

## Results

- The results show promising performance in brain tumor detection.
- Visualizations of correctly classified and misclassified cases are provided in the `results` folder.
- Additional details and analysis can be found in the accompanying research paper.
